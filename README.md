##  **Character Cards**

Character Card is a plugin that provides an immersive way for players to build and display personal character cards on your server. Designed for roleplay-focused communities, it introduces character card that store information such as name, age, race, lore, gender, and custom descriptions. Players can access their cards in multiple ways, edit it and view other player's cards. You can also shift click players to see their character card!

There is also integrated local chat, that allows players to talk locally and roleplay without sending everything on global chat, with a command that allows spying on all local chats to ease in moderation

Plugin also provides Lands and Placeholder api optional dependency, allowing character cards to contain information from different plugins on the server

With the essentialsX compatibility, players nickname can be changed based on the name set in the Character Card and optionally /realname command can get support for tab completion, special characters and spaces

Every line of the character card is changeable in the config, with a placeholder for player's values

Players can also use MiniMessage formatting to add color and effects to the text
